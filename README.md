- 👋 Hi, I’m @KDA-Coding
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Unity, XAML, Blender, and NoesisGUI
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Game Jams or Front-End projects to improve my knowledge and abilities as a developer
- 📫 You can reach me at kirk.allgeyer@gmail.com

I'm a college student of 4 years at ECPI University, graduating with my Bachelor's in Software Development by November. I hope to take the skills I've learned from ECPI, 
skills I sought out and studied independently, and new skills gained from collaboration projects or work to build and launch my own game development company.
